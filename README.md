## Single-view Hair Reconstruction (NEW!)

While we are working on a reimplementation of our single-view reconstruction pipeline (which may be released in the future depending on my availability), we have released an **uncurated*** set of single-view reconstruction results to facilitate comparison and benchmarking. These results are obtained by running Perm on online portrait images, which can be downloaded from this [OneDrive link](https://yaleedu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/chengan_he_yale_edu/EvTqlju7SolPp8vJMgAqczABEAJKQBSt3HBN_Yn8WogOIg) (`perm_single_view.tar.gz`).

In the released data, we include 78 examples of fitted body meshes (`iter00001_body.ply`), fitted hair strands (`_stage3_stepC_trim_mask_placed.abc` or `_stage3_stepC_trim_mask_placed.temp.data`), and the corresponding RGB images. A sample blender file (`000000.blend`) is included as well, which can be used as a template to render all the hairstyles. We provide a visual overview of all reconstructed hairstyles below:
![](perm_single_view.png)

These results span a range of quality — including successful reconstructions, partial failures, and some examples that appear plausible from the input viewpoint but exhibit depth issues when viewed from other angles. Due to limitations in training data, curly/kinky hairstyles are currently not well reconstructed. Overall, we believe this release provides a broad view of what our Perm model can achieve under single-view input settings, and we hope future research can build upon and improve the quality with our released data.

Also note that some fitted body meshes look weird due to the artifacts of [DELTA](https://github.com/yfeng95/DELTA). We truly believe their quality can be improved with more advanced single-view body fitting algorithms.

> Though uncurated, a few completely failed examples are excluded, which are mainly caused by the errors in the estimated strand maps.

## Getting started

### Installation

Before installing perm, make sure you have CUDA Toolkit 11.3 (or later) installed as noted in [EG3D/StyleGAN3](https://github.com/NVlabs/eg3d/tree/main#requirements), which would be required to compile customized CUDA ops.
CUDA Toolkit 11.3 has been tested on my machine with Ubuntu 22.04, which also requires `gcc <= 10` (I use `gcc=10.5.0`). 
You can use the following commands with Miniconda3 to create and activate your Python environment:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate perm
pip install -r requirements.txt --no-cache-dir
```

### Pre-trained models

Pre-trained networks can be downloaded and extracted from this [OneDrive link](https://yaleedu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/chengan_he_yale_edu/ESQ2YM2wd39Fg2PNrUQRV_cBg61LQWPFp7xhuq3knOkNtw?e=33h7pF), which are stored as `*.pkl` files following the format of EG3D.

You can use pre-trained networks in your own Python code as follows:
```python
from hair.hair_models import Perm

device = torch.device('cuda')
# main hair model
hair_model = Perm(model_path=model_path, head_mesh=head_mesh, scalp_bounds=scalp_bounds).eval().requires_grad_(False).to(device)
# pre-defined root set
roots, _ = hair_model.hair_roots.load_txt(roots)
roots = roots.to(device)
# output dictionary that contains:
# 1. "image": hair geometry texture, NCHW.
# 2. "strands": sampled and decoded strands.
# 3. "guide_strands": decoded guide strands.
# 4. "theta" and "beta": input or randomly sampled parameters.
out = hair_model(roots=roots.unsqueeze(0), trunc=truncation_psi, trunc_cutoff=truncation_cutoff, random_seed=seed)
```
The above code will use `torch_utils` and `dnnlib` to load the downloaded pickle files, which does not require source code for the networks themselves — their class definitions are loaded from the pickle via `torch_utils.persistence`.

Please refer to [`gen_samples.py`](src/gen_samples.py) for complete code example.

### Generating hairstyles

To generate 3D hairstyles using our pre-trained model, run:
```bash
python src/gen_samples.py --outdir=out --model={model_folder} --roots=data/roots/rootPositions_10k.txt --head_mesh=data/head.obj --seeds=0-99 --trunc=0.8
```
Here `model_folder` should be replaced with the folder containing all `*.pkl` checkpoints. The hairstyles shown in Fig. 5 of our supplemental are generated using seeds `0,14,20,71,78,79,87,88,89,92`.

### Hair parameterization

To fit perm parameters to a given 3D hairstyle, run:
```bash
python src/projector.py --model={model_folder} --target={target_data} --num-steps-warmup=1000 --num-steps=9000 --outdir=fitting --head_mesh=data/head.obj --save-video=false
```
Here `target_data` refers to the processed hair geomerty texture stored in `*.npz` format, which will be mentioned below.

We fitted perm parameters to all 343 USC-HairSalon hairstyles, which can be downloaded from this [OneDrive link](https://yaleedu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/chengan_he_yale_edu/ESmIHlb9IN5NlyRsQnl94mQBmiHEI7gR1tgpFPsEMJomqQ?e=GcrDRi). To convert these parameters back to 3D hairstyles, run:
```bash
python src/gen_from_parameters.py --model={model_folder} --params={npz_param_file} --outdir=fitting/usc-hair --head_mesh data/head.obj
```

### Hairstyle interpolation

To interpolate between two given hairstyles, run:
```bash
python src/style_mixing.py --model={model_folder} --hair1={hair1_data} --hair2={hair2_data} --steps=5 --outdir=lerp --head_mesh=data/head.obj --interp_mode={full, theta, beta}
```
Here `hair1_data` and `hair2_data` correspond to the two processed hair geomerty textures, `steps` controls the number of interpolation steps, and `interp_mode` supports different granularities such as theta only, beta only, and joint interpolation. 

## Datasets

### Hair20k

We name our training set Hair20k, an augmented version of [USC-HairSalon](https://huliwenkidkid.github.io/liwenhu.github.io/) that contains ~20k hairstyles. More information can be found on this [dataset page](https://zhouyisjtu.github.io/project_hair/hair20k.html). Please download the data aligned with the AVATAR NEO head to `data/usc-hair` and `data/usc-hair-mix`, or create symbolic links under the `data` directory.

### Data processing

To generate necessary data for perm, run the following script:
```bash
bash scripts/process-usc-hair.sh
```
This script will:
1. horizontally flip each hairstyle to further augment the dataset.
2. solve PCA blend shapes for hair strands.
3. fit geomerty textures with PCA coefficients (nearest interpolation produces better results than bilinear when sampled with different hair roots).
4. compress geomerty textures from `256x256` to `32x32` to obtain textures for **guide strands**.

The PCA fitting process has a certain demand on the memory size. In our experiments, 64GB memory should be enough for all USC-HairSalon strands. The fitted geometry textures are stored as `*.npz` files, which include:
- `texture`: the texture itself, CHW.
- `mask`: baldness map of the hairstyle, 1HW.
- `roots`: 2D roots of strands in the uv space.

The processed data from the above pipeline (original 3D hair models, PCA blend shapes, fitted geometry textures) can be downloaded from this [OneDrive link](https://yaleedu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/chengan_he_yale_edu/EvTqlju7SolPp8vJMgAqczABEAJKQBSt3HBN_Yn8WogOIg), where:
- `hair20k.tar.gz` contains all the hair models we augmented from USC-HairSalon (already mirrored, 21,054 hairstyles in total).
- `blend-shapes.tar.gz` contains the solved PCA blend shapes for strands.
- `neural-textures.tar.gz` contains the fitted textures for each hairstyle.

## Training

**StyleGAN2:** To train a StyleGAN2 backbone for our guide textures, run:
```bash
bash scripts/train-rawtex.sh
```

**U-Net:** To train a U-Net as our superresolution module, run:
```bash
bash scripts/train-superres.sh
```

**VAE:** To train a VAE backbone for our residual textures, run:
```bash
bash scripts/train-restex.sh
```

## Evaluation

We report the mean position error (pos. err.) and mean curvature error (cur. err.) as the measurement of our hair reconstruction quality. The usage of these two metrics can be found in `src/eval_blend_shapes.py`.

## Rendering

Most of the figures in our paper are rendered using [Hair Tool](https://joseconseco.github.io/HairTool_3_Documentation/) in Blender. We highly recommend checking out this excellent addon!

Note that some generated hairstyles may contain extremely short strands, which are caused by the expressive limitations of PCA (those zero-length strands after PCA projection and decoding). To filter out these strands and produce a clean rendering, run:
```bash
python src/preprocess.py --process_fn=filter --indir={input_data_folder} --outdir={output_data_folder} --length=2
```
Here `input_data_folder` are the folder of hairstyles stored in `*.data` format.

These filtered results can be converted to `*.obj` files for Blender rendering using:
```bash
python src/preprocess.py --process_fn=convert --indir={input_data_folder} --outdir={output_obj_folder}
```
